Repository Name: BASIC_DJANGO_REACT_WEBAPP

Description:
BASIC_DJANGO_REACT_WEBAPP is a simple web application template that combines Django on the backend and React.js on the frontend. This repository serves as a starting point for building full-stack web applications with Django and React, providing a basic structure to get started quickly.

Features:

Django Backend: The repository includes a Django backend application that serves as the API for the web application. It handles data storage, retrieval, and processing.

React Frontend: The frontend of the web application is built using React.js, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.

RESTful API: The Django backend follows RESTful principles, allowing for easy integration with the React frontend.

Authentication: User authentication is implemented using Django's built-in authentication system. Users can register, log in, and log out of the application.

Database Integration: The backend is set up to work with SQLite by default, but it can be easily configured to use other databases supported by Django, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Folder Structure:

backend: Contains the Django backend application.
frontend: Contains the React frontend application.
templates: Django templates for rendering HTML pages.
How to Use:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the backend folder and create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
python -m venv env
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source env/bin/activate
Install Django and other dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install React dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
Back in the backend folder, apply migrations to set up the database:

Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Start the Django development server:

Copy code
python manage.py runserver
In a separate terminal, start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm start
The web application should now be running. Access it in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
